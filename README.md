# *Defining Design* Visual Assets 
![UX Design](/GIFs/GIF-UX.gif)


The sourcefiles and assets I used to create the [Defining Design presentation] (https://medium.com/hh-design/defining-the-big-d-afc856b4b8d) I gave at PennApps.

Curious about my presentation workflow?  [Read this] (https://medium.com/p/a-visual-approach-to-scientific-communication-68c868b69d6b).  

## Organization and Construction
Individual slides are located in [/Slides](/Slides).

These are imported into the [After Effects Project](/Presentation.aep) as individual compositions, animated, and strung together in the Main composition.  This main composition is rendered into an mp4 (not included).  

The [Final PowerPoint](/PowerPoint.pptm) embeds the rendered video and contains bookmarks and animation triggers such that the presentation automatically pauses at slide points.  Thus, the presentation can be operated like a normal PowerPoint.  

The [After Effects Project](/Presentation.aep) contains secondary compositions that render select animations into GIFs that are embedded into the [Medium Article](https://medium.com/hh-design/defining-the-big-d-afc856b4b8d) (and posted on dribbble :-P).
